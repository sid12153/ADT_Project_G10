# Dataset: 
The CityLink National Rideshare Hub dataset is a fictional collection of ride-sharing details meant to mirror the day-to-day operations of a ride-sharing company. It's created to help the company analyze and enhance their service by tracking rides, understanding customer preferences, and managing payments.
Basically, the dataset would include:
- Ride IDs and user IDs to keep tabs on rides and users.
- Start and end cities for each trip.
- Timings for when the rides begin.
- The number of seats offered and taken.
- The type of car being driven.
- The cost for each seat and payment details.
This data helps the company understand where and when people travel, how they like to ride, and how the business can grow and serve better.
For creating such a dataset, we're taking inspiration from existing datasets on Kaggle, which provide us with insights into car rentals and store locations. These real-world data sources help simulate a realistic service platform for CityLink.
